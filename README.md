##  Overview
This project explores **mental health trends in Canada between 2021 and 2023**, using official data from **Statistics Canada**.  
The analysis examines **regional disparities**, **gender differences**, and **national recovery trends** following the COVID-19 pandemic — using **Google Sheets** for data cleaning, visualization, and trend analysis.

---

##  Key Findings
- **Gradual recovery:** National well-being improved slightly between 2022–2023 after a sharp decline in 2021–2022.  
- **Gender disparities:** Men reported higher perceived mental health than women across all provinces.  
- **Regional trends:** Quebec and Newfoundland maintained above-average well-being, while Ontario and Nova Scotia lagged behind.  
- **National stabilization:** Average well-being stabilized around **47%**, showing early signs of recovery.

##  Methods & Tools
- **Data Source:** Statistics Canada, *Table 45-10-0079-01 — Perceived Mental Health by Gender and Province (Quarterly)*  
- **Tools Used:** Google Sheets (data cleaning, pivot charts, bar & line visualization)  
- **Techniques:**  
  - Data import and formatting  
  - Trend and variance analysis  
  - Comparative visualization by region and gender

##  Insights
Persistent **gender and regional gaps** indicate that community factors — such as access to care and local support networks — strongly affect well-being.  
This analysis highlights the need for **localized mental health programs** and continued tracking of post-pandemic recovery trends.

##  Reflection
> “Data reveals stories of resilience, inequality, and recovery.”  

Through this project, I learned to apply **data analytics in a social context** — from cleaning and visualizing datasets to interpreting trends that reflect real-world experiences.
